# Git and GitHub

## Git

-   Configuration: git config \--local

### Repository

-   project folder in which changes are tracked by git

-   contains .git file (?)
    
-   can be locally stored or hosted on GitHub
    
-   git init

-   Stages

    -   Modified (green) - \> Staging -\> Commit(snapshot at that
        particular point)

    -   Commit =\> take everything from staging area and make a
        "save-point"

-   Creating a repository -- git init

-   Staging files

    -   git status

    -   Add to staging: git add \<file\> (Add everything to staging: git
        add . )

    -   Remove from staging: git rm --cached \<file\>

    -   Adding files to the staging area allows us to review the code
        before committing it (an extra blanket of security)

    -   allows to have separate commits for separate changes

-   Commit

    -   git commit -m "\<descriptive message of what the commit is
        about\>"

    -   To view commit history: git log (OR) git log \--oneline

    -   To get a graph of commits do `git log --graph --decorate  --oneline --all`  

-   Uploading to GitHub from a local repository

## Merging
-   Scenario 1: When the local repository is ahead of the remote by some commits
    and the remote also has commits that were *not* pulled by the local *before*
    it made those commits.
    ```
    // before merge
    * LOCAL ORIGIN HEAD
    *
    *
    | REMOTE ORIGIN HEAD
    |/
    *
    *

    // after merge
    * LOCAL ORIGIN HEAD
     \
    * |
    * |
    | REMOTE ORIGIN HEAD
    |/
    *
    *
    // the merge itself is a separate commit, but that is not shown here.
    ```

-   Sync local repository with upstream
    ```
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/master
    ```
-   `HEAD`
-   Stash
-   Merge
-   Rebase
-   Reset
-   Revert
-   Modifying/ reverting commits
    -   Undo previous commit
    ```
    git reset HEAD~
    # make necessary changes and commit again
    ```
    -   Checkout file to previous state and amend commit
    ```
    git checkout HEAD~ file.txt
    git commit --amend
    ```
    -   Hard 'delete' commits
    `git reset --hard [commit_id_start]..[commit_id_end]`
    -   [Source 1](https://remarkablemark.org/blog/2017/09/19/revert-file-after-commit/), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-do-i-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit)

### Pulling a change from multiple branches
- `git cherry-pick [commit-id]`
  - In case of conflict, resolve conflict and do `git commit --no-verify`
  - [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65224262/how-do-you-git-cherry-pick-continue-with-no-verify)

### `git mergetool`
- Refer [here](https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/f19ff75c60f18b4b8149) for a
  detailed description on using `mergetool`
- **Note**: Once `mergetool` is opened, do not quit until the conflicts are
  resolved.
